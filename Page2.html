        <h1><u>MY EXPERIENCE</u></h1>
        

        <h1>IFIX IOS STUDIO</h1>
        <p>Technician</p>
        <p align="justify">I got into tech stuff when i'm Form 1. I kept taking apart and fixing my own phone, and I got pretty good at it. By Form 3, "Abang Man" from iFix iOS Studio noticed my skills and offered me a part-time job at his place in Setia Alam. Working there as a technician, I dived into the world of fixing phones. I've fixed over 100 phones, mostly iPhones. This tech journey started when I was young, and it's not just a personal hobby; it shows how dedicated I am to this tech stuff.</p>

        <h1>UNIVERSAL MUSIC MALAYSIA</h1>
        <p>Ghostwriter/Composer</p>
        <p align="justify">In the wake of the pandemic, my interests took a fresh turn, and one of the new paths I embraced was songwriting. Writing has always been my thing, and coupling it with my love for music, I transformed my words into melodies. I poured every emotion into my lyrics, believing that each song could have its own soul. It's not just a personal endeavor â€“ I reached out to an artist from Universal Music Malaysia by sending numerous emails, and to my delight, my lyrics were picked up and turned into a song. Being dubbed a "ghostwriter" because I lacked formal qualifications as a lyricist doesn't bother me. Alongside this musical journey, I've also dedicated time to learn keyboard skills through special classes.</p>

        <h1>HERMANOS BARBERSHOP</h1>
        <p>Barber</p>
        <p align="justify">Also since the pandemic, I got into cutting hair. I learned by watching others and YouTube. My first try was on my sister, and it took me all day from 8 am to 8 pm, but it turned out okay. To get faster and better, I practiced on family and friends, then started helping people outside my circle. In 2021, I began offering home service, cutting hair at people's houses. I shared my work on social media, and that's how Hermanos Barbershop found me on Instagram. They asked me to join them, and they've been guiding me ever since. I still work there today, enjoying every moment of this unexpected journey into the world of hair cutting..</p>
